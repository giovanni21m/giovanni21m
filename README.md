- 👋 Hi, I’m @giovanni21m or Giovanni Martinez. 
- 👀 I’m interested in travelling, learning (yes, actually), training my Dutch Shepherd, and going to car based events.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Web Development. I put it off for some time as I had more of an interest in mobile development, but I absolutely love web dev and
-     it's time I finally enter the industry head strong.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects that contribute to making life easier.
